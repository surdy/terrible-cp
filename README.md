### What is this ?
In its final form it will be easy way to spin up infra (using terraform) and install Confluent Platform on it using [cp-ansible](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible). Right now it just creates a host.yml for the infra created.

### Why terrible ? 
Becuase I'm terrible and I find humor in the fact that terraform + ansible can be portmanteau-ed to **terrible** (terransible is not as funny)

### How do I use it ?
Bro do you even read code !! Code is the documentation !! start with variables.tf and terraform.tfvars to see whats configurable
